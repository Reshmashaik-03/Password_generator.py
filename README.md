Strong Password Generator:
A simple yet robust command-line Python application that generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. This tool helps users create secure passwords by allowing them to specify length and include various character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

âœ¨ Features
Customizable Length: Generate passwords of any specified length.

Character Type Selection: Choose to include or exclude:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Digits (0-9)

Common symbols (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)

Guaranteed Inclusion: Ensures at least one character from each selected type is present (if the length allows), enhancing password strength.

Randomized Order: Shuffles the generated characters to prevent predictable patterns.

User-Friendly Interface: Interactive command-line prompts for easy configuration.

Generate Again Option: Allows generating multiple passwords without restarting the script.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the script):

git clone https://github.com/Reshmashaik-03/password_generator.git
cd password-generator


No external libraries are required as this project uses only built-in Python modules (random, string).

Running the Application
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved password_generator.py.

Run the script using Python:

python password_generator.py


Follow the interactive prompts to configure your password:

Enter the desired password length.

Answer "yes" or "no" for each character type inclusion.

ðŸ’¡ Example Usage
--- Strong Password Generator ---
Enter desired password length (e.g., 12): 16
Include uppercase letters (A-Z)? (yes/no): yes
Include lowercase letters (a-z)? (yes/no): yes
Include digits (0-9)? (yes/no): yes
Include symbols (!@#$%^&*...)? (yes/no): yes

Generated Password: J!p9@qL8$zW2mN7&

--- Another Password? ---
Generate another password? (yes/no): yes
--- Strong Password Generator ---
Enter desired password length (e.g., 12): 10
Include uppercase letters (A-Z)? (yes/no): no
Include lowercase letters (a-z)? (yes/no): yes
Include digits (0-9)? (yes/no): yes
Include symbols (!@#$%^&*...)? (yes/no): no

Generated Password: a7b3c2d1e9

--- Another Password? ---
Generate another password? (yes/no): no
Exiting password generator. Goodbye!


ðŸ“‚ Code Structure
The project consists of a single Python file: password_generator.py.

generate_password(length, include_uppercase, ...) function:

Constructs a pool of allowed characters based on user preferences.

Ensures at least one character from each selected type is included to guarantee strength.

Fills the rest of the password length with random characters from the pool.

Randomly shuffles the resulting characters to prevent predictable patterns.

Returns the final password string.

Main execution block (if __name__ == "__main__":):

Handles user interaction via command-line prompts.

Validates input for password length.

Calls the generate_password function and prints the result.

Provides a loop to generate multiple passwords.

ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
GUI Interface: Implement a graphical user interface using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or CustomTkinter for a more visual experience.

Password Strength Indicator: Add a feature to evaluate and display the strength of the generated password (e.g., "Weak", "Medium", "Strong").

Copy to Clipboard: Add functionality to automatically copy the generated password to the clipboard.

Custom Symbol Set: Allow users to define their own set of symbols.

Batch Generation: Option to generate multiple passwords at once.
